Classes and Objects :
-> Here remember we have 4 major pillors on OOPs

1. Polymorphism
2. Abstraction
3. Inheritance
4. Encapsulation

Shallow & Deep Copy
-> A shallow copy of an object copies all of the member values from one object to another.
-> A deep copy, on the other hand, not only copies the member values but also makes copies of 
any dynamically allocated memory that the members point to.
