Alphabets: Uppercase and lowercase letters 
Digits: The numbers 0â€“9 
Special characters: Symbols like +, -, *, /, =, <, >, &, |, !, ^, ~, %, #, \, ;, :, ', " and more

Escape sequences: Special meaning characters prefixed with a backslash, such as \n (newline), \t (tab), 
\\ (backslash character), \' (single quote), and \" (double quote) 

Tokens
Tokens are the smallest units in a C program, similar to Lego blocks. Some types of tokens include: 
Identifiers: Names given to variables, functions, and arrays 
Keywords: Reserved words in C that must be written in lowercase 
Operators: Symbols that operate on one or more operands to give an output 
Strings: Sequences of characters enclosed within single or double quotation marks
