What the hell is DEADLOCK ?
Deadlock is a situation in multithreading where two or more threads are blocked forever, waiting for each other to release a 
resource. This typically occurs when two or more threads have circular dependencies on a set of locks.


Deadlocks typically occur when four conditions are met simultaneously:
1. Mutual Exclusion: Only one thread can access a resource at a time.
2. Hold and Wait: A thread holding at least one resource is waiting to acquire additional resources held by other threads.
3. No Preemption: Resources cannot be forcibly taken from threads holding them.
4. Circular Wait: A set of threads is waiting for each other in a circular chain.
