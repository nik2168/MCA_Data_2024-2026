Locks in Java Multithreading

There are mainly two kinds of Locks

1. Intrinsic

These are built into every object in Java.
You don't see them, but they're there.
When you use a synchronized keyword, you're using these automatic locks.



2. Explicit

These are more advanced locks you can control
yourself using the Lock class from java.util.concurrent.locks.
You explicitly say when to lock and unlock, giving you more control over how and when people can write in the notebook.
